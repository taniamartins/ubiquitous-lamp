My journey, as I hope it is reflected in this blog, has been made up of a lots of twists and turns. I want to focus on four distinct dimensions, each shaping my journey in its own way:

ðŸš€ Learning & Growth:
Embarking on an internship and pursuing my master's degree has been a whirlwind of experiences and emotions. Through my blog, I'm here to share the ups and downs, the breakthroughs and challenges, and the immense satisfaction of continuous learning. Expect to hear about the projects that have ignited my passion, the insights that have widened my perspectives, and the skills that I've been honing, both in the technical realm and within the tapestry of human connections.

ðŸŒˆ Embracing Neurodiversity:
But there's more to my journey than the titles and degrees. I'm proudly neurodivergent, and I believe that embracing our differences is what truly makes us exceptional. I'll be candidly sharing how my neurodiversity shapes my experiences, the unique perspectives it brings to the table, and the ways it influences my growth and interactions.

ðŸŒ± Reflection and Inspiration:
This blog is more than just a collection of words; it's my personal sanctuary of reflection. It's where I pause to appreciate how far I've come and envision the paths that lie ahead. If my experiences and insights resonate with you, if they spark your own moments of reflection and growth, then that's the icing on the cake.

ðŸ”§ Technical Adventures:
As a passionate explorer of AI and data science, I'm excited to share my exploration of research papers and articles that have captured my curiosity. For beginners setting out on the exhilarating journey of AI and data science, I'll be curating resources to light your path and simplify the complexities.

So, whether you're here for a dose of inspiration, to navigate the world of AI and data science, or to embrace the beauty of neurodiversity, I'm beyond grateful that our paths have converged here. Let's learn, grow, and celebrate the remarkable tapestry of our lives together. ðŸŒ±ðŸ§ 

Here's to the journey ahead! ðŸš€

Warmly,
tania
